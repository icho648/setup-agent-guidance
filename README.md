[简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

A Claude Code and Codex marketplace for crafted Agent workflows. Add `flowcrafter` once, then install Rit’s personal workflow bundle, the PRD delivery workflow, or both.

## Plugins

| Plugin | Included skills | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [rit-plugin](plugins/rit-plugin/) | `setup-agent-guidance`, `grounded-explainer`, `learn` | Rit’s project-guidance, explanation, and learning workflows share one personal bundle. |
| [prd-workflow](plugins/prd-workflow/) | `write-prd`, `implement-prd`, `review-prd-implementation` | Implementation has a hard dependency on the review loop, so the PRD skills install together. |

The GitHub repository name and Marketplace ID are both `flowcrafter`.

## Install

### Codex

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add icho648/flowcrafter
codex plugin add rit-plugin@flowcrafter
codex plugin add prd-workflow@flowcrafter
```

Install either plugin or both. Start a new Codex task afterward so the selected skills are discovered.

### Claude Code

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add icho648/flowcrafter
claude plugin install rit-plugin@flowcrafter
claude plugin install prd-workflow@flowcrafter
```

Restart Claude Code after installation. Claude Code invocations are namespaced, for example `/rit-plugin:learn` and `/prd-workflow:write-prd`; Codex invokes the same skills as `$learn` and `$write-prd`.

### Migrate from `icho648-skills`

The former Marketplace ID and all-in-one plugin are replaced by `flowcrafter` and two focused plugins:

```bash
# Codex
codex plugin remove icho648-plugin@icho648-skills
codex plugin marketplace remove icho648-skills
codex plugin marketplace add icho648/flowcrafter
codex plugin add rit-plugin@flowcrafter
codex plugin add prd-workflow@flowcrafter
```

```bash
# Claude Code
claude plugin uninstall icho648-plugin@icho648-skills
claude plugin marketplace remove icho648-skills
claude plugin marketplace add icho648/flowcrafter
claude plugin install rit-plugin@flowcrafter
claude plugin install prd-workflow@flowcrafter
```

Skip any removal command for an item that was not installed.

### Manual skill installation

Each `plugins/<plugin>/skills/<skill>/` directory is a portable Agent Skills package. Clone the repository, then copy or symlink the desired skill into `$HOME/.claude/skills/` or `$HOME/.agents/skills/`.

When installing `implement-prd` manually, also install `review-prd-implementation`; the review loop is a hard dependency.

└── AGENTS.md                             # Marketplace maintenance policy
```

Each plugin has client-specific manifests in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`. Its canonical Agent Skills live under `skills/`.

## Compatibility model

- The Claude Code Marketplace and plugin manifests provide Claude distribution and command namespacing.
- The Codex Marketplace and plugin manifests provide Codex distribution and presentation metadata.
- Every `skills/<name>/` directory follows the cross-client Agent Skills package structure and can also be installed without the plugin wrapper.

## Maintenance

- Treat a plugin as an install, version, and dependency boundary.
- Keep the Claude Code and Codex marketplace entries and manifests synchronized.
- Keep hard-dependent skills in the same plugin.
- Keep English and Simplified Chinese resource pairs in semantic lockstep.

## Validate

```bash
for skill in plugins/*/skills/*; do
  python -m skills_ref.cli validate "$skill"
done

for plugin in plugins/*; do
  python ~/.codex/skills/.system/plugin-creator/scripts/validate_plugin.py "$plugin"
done

python .github/scripts/validate_repository.py
python -m unittest tests/test_validate_repository.py
```

GitHub Actions runs the same repository, Skill, Marketplace, and Plugin checks on pushes and pull requests.
