# Interactive Project Onboarding

## Goal

Generate concise project guidance and code-review standards from verifiable repository facts. Do not read every file mechanically, and do not turn common knowledge, model capabilities, or unconfirmed personal preferences into project rules.

## Read-only scan

Prioritize:

1. The repository root, existing `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, README, contribution guide, and architecture docs.
2. Package manifests, lockfiles, build configuration, and primary entry points.
3. CI workflows, PR templates, CODEOWNERS, and release configuration.
4. Test directories and test, lint, format, type-check, coverage, and security-tool configuration.
5. Database migrations, public APIs, protocols, persisted formats, and deployment entry points.
6. A few representative business modules and tests to check whether actual conventions match configuration.

Skip dependency directories, build output, caches, binaries, large generated files, credentials, and secrets. Unless the user asks, do not run formatters, migrations, code generation, installation, or other commands that rewrite files.

## Build a candidate project profile

Use evidence to identify:

- Key directories, module boundaries, and runtime entry points.
- Start, build, test, and static-analysis commands confirmed by configuration.
- CI gates that actually block merge.
- High-risk areas involving public interfaces, migrations, security, or performance.
- Existing engineering conventions and definitions of done.
- Conflicting evidence, stale commands, and remaining unknowns.

Every conclusion should point to a concrete repository file. Do not invent project rules from language or framework convention.

## Confirm with the user

Show concise findings first, then ask only about choices that the user must make. Ask no more than three short questions per round, prioritizing:

1. Which commands or checks must block merge.
2. Review risk priorities such as correctness, security, compatibility, performance, or UI.
3. Team preferences that the repository cannot prove, such as TDD, coverage, supported versions, migrations, and severity policy.

If the user does not answer, leave those items unconfirmed rather than silently making them mandatory. Do not ask questions answerable from repository configuration, CI, or documentation.

## Draft and confirm

1. Use the project block in `assets/AGENTS.<locale>.template.md` to draft an `agent-guidance:project` block. Remove missing commands and empty headings.
2. Use `assets/CODE_REVIEW.<locale>.template.md` to draft repository-root `code_review.md`. Remove every placeholder and generation note.
3. Keep content short, specific, and executable. Test commands must state their working directory and purpose.
4. Show the proposed content or diff and wait for explicit user approval.
5. Write only after approval. If the user approves only part, apply only that part.

## Updating existing rules

- `agent-guidance:core` may be updated automatically from the template.
- `agent-guidance:project` and `code_review.md` are user-owned project rules. After rescanning, propose diffs rather than overwriting silently.
- If existing guidance conflicts with repository evidence, show the conflict and evidence, then let the user keep, change, or remove it.
- Do not delete content outside managed blocks.
